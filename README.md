🔧 Configuration

Model Settings

Edit simple_rag.py to adjust model parameters:

    self.llm = Llama(
        model_path=model_path,
        n_ctx=1024,          # Context window size
        n_threads=6,         # CPU threads (adjust for your system)
        n_batch=256,         # Batch size
        use_mlock=True,      # Keep model in memory
    )

Document Processing

Supported file formats:

    .txt - Plain text files

    .md - Markdown files

Documents should be in English for optimal retrieval performance.


Admin Authentication

Change the default admin password in app.py:
    
    if password == 'your-new-password':  # Change from 'admin123'

Adding New Languages

  The system automatically supports any language that Gemma can understand. No additional configuration needed.
  
  Just add new LLMs to model folder and get all the languages it can understand without additional setup

Performance Optimization

    Model Size: Use Q4_K_M quantization for best speed/quality balance

    Context Window: Reduce n_ctx for faster responses

    Document Chunks: Limit chunk size to 500 characters

    Response Length: Cap at 150 tokens for quick responses

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues

"No model loaded" error

    Solution: Go to admin panel and load a model first

Model loading is slow

    Solution: Ensure you have enough RAM and use a smaller model

Documents not found during sync

    Solution: Check that files are in data/ folder with .txt or .md extension

Chat responses are slow

    Solution: Reduce max_tokens in simple_rag.py or use a smaller model

Admin panel not accessible

    Solution: Check the URL (http://localhost:5000/admin) and password

Performance Tips

    Use SSD storage for faster model loading

    Increase RAM for better performance with larger models

    Adjust thread count based on your CPU cores

    Limit document size for faster retrieval
